{"name":"Dungeons And Dragons Tools in Python","tagline":"Save yourself the trouble of throwing hundreds of dices at a time!","body":"#HUGE UPDATE!!\r\n##Version 1.0 is HERE!\r\n###(For MACOS at least)\r\n\r\nYess!! Finally my suite of tools is here and it's working like a charm!!\r\n\r\nRight now I got the tools I want to finish outlined as code as well as GUI\r\n####BUT\r\nI find Tkinter kinda boring and sad so first I'll create a Windows release for some of my friends to test out the app and, after that, I'll start rewriting the whole GUI using more appealing libraries.\r\nMy main idea is to use Kivy (http://kivy.org/), but I'm researching more and I'll decide when it's time.\r\nIn *Releases* you can find the .app file to run it on MacOS, so that you can test it.\r\nBear in mind that most of the funtionalities are really basic: the weapon generator is to be completely rewritten, the encounter generator features only town encounter generation, the NPC generator generates characteristics that are awful and unusable and it generates only NPC to be fought and, finally, I want to expand even more the database for the name generator and implement better algorithms overall.\r\n\r\nIn the end I'm very happy for this 1.0 release and I hope that this application finds some use in some D&D campaigns around the world.\r\nIf you have any idea or you wish that some features were implemented don't hesitate contacting me!!\r\n\r\nA quick final recap:\r\nRight now the app consists in:\r\n- A basic dice roller,\r\n- A basic weapon generator,\r\n- A name generator,\r\n- A NPC generator,\r\n- A random encounter generator.\r\n\r\nAll of these have to be expanded and improved, but this is just the beginning!!\r\n\r\nPietro Bongiovanni\r\nbongiovanni.pietro.vc@gmail.com\r\n4800 Ca'oan Road - Jiading - Shanghai - China\r\n@pietrogoodjohn on Twitter\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
