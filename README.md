Hi!
This is my little suit of D&D tools written in Python.
I just started working with Python and since I am mastering a D&D campaign I thought I'd make my job easier by programming some little tools to help in some tasks and avoid throwing tons of dices.
If you want to use any of this little scripts feel free to do it.
Feel free to modify them and, if you want, send me an email with the changes and the uses you put these codes to. My contacts are at the end of this file.
Have fun with programming and Dungeons and Dragons!!

UPDATE 25/11/2015
I finally finished my finals and I started working on the project again!
I've done the GUI for the dice roller and I'm very happy about it!
On to the next step.

UPDATE 1/12/2015

Right now I have:
- A Dice Roller.
- The basics of a Magic Weapon Generator.
- A name generator with an expanding database of names
- A NPC Generator
- A main GUI that collects all the single GUIs into a single one.

What I am working on right now:
- Finishing the Weapon Generator, I have all the ideas written on a piece of paper so I just need to translate them in code.
- Starting gathering information from the manuals for the armor generator
- Expanding the Database of names
- The encounter generator. It seems real fun, I'll have a blast thinking about all the possible events

What I want to have in the end:
- A armor Generator
- A book generator
- Some other stuff, that I might find myself needing while I'm mastering my campaign.
