#Dungeons And Dragons Tools

Hello there!

If you came in here there is a good chance you like D&D and you either are a player or a DM.
If you ever found yourself throwing tons and tons and tons of dices or spent hours on generators, this is the application for you!

Generate whatever you want, from Weapons, to random encounters to full NPCs ready to be met or fought.

So right now I have completed a very basic release, I'd not even call it an Alpha version, using some really basic graphics.
I wanted to see how the app would behave on different systems and I'm quite pleased with how it turend out.

As I'm updating this Readme I have already began working on a new graphic and I got it working on Mac, on PC and on Android; but I'm still focusing on the single scripts, trying to improve them and trying to expand the databases.

If you want to try the application (if you do, feedback would be *highly* appreciated), you can find the .exe or .app files in *Releases*, depending on what your system is.

Also if you want something to be implemented in the app be sure to email me or tweet at me, my contacts can be found at the end of this Readme!!

A quick final recap:
Right now the app consists in:
- A basic dice roller,
- A basic weapon generator,
- A name generator,
- A NPC generator,
- A random encounter generator.

What I'm working on is:
- Creating more types of encounter and improving what I already have
- Expanding the database of the names and working on algorithms to implement to generate better names.
