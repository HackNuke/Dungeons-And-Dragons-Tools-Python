Hi!
This is my little suit of D&D tools written in Python.
I just started working with Python and since I am mastering a D&D campaign I thought I'd make my job easier by programming some little tools to help in some tasks and avoid throwing tons of dices.
If you want to use any of this little scripts feel free to do it.
Feel free to modify them and, if you want, send me an email with the changes and the uses you put these codes to. My contacts are at the end of this file.
Have fun with programming and Dungeons and Dragons!!

Right now I have:
- A command line interface dice roller
- The basics of a Magic Weapon Generator.

What I am working on right now:
- A graphic user interface for my dice roller, still thinking about how I want it to look and to work
- Finishing the Weapon Generator, I have all the ideas written on a piece of paper so I just need to translate them in code.

What I want to have in the end:
- A armor Generator
- A random encounter Generator
- A random NPC Generator
- A single GUI which incorporates all these little scripts
- Some other stuff, that I might find myself needing while I'm mastering my campaign.
